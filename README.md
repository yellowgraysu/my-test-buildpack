# Heroku Buildpack for Flutter
![header]
Automate your deployments on Heroku easily.

## üî® Setup

#### Add this Buildpack in your Heroku app 
   In dashboard:
   
   You can copy the [link](https://github.com/diezep/heroku-buildpack-flutter) of this repository and paste it in buildpacks or write **diezep/flutter** and will be added automatically.
   
   In Heroku CLI:

#### Optional

   You can add optional [environment variables](#-environment-variables) to customize the deployment of your project but nothing is required, all are optional.
  
## üöß Environment variables:

All variables were built following the structure **FLUTTER_VARNAME** to identified easily in Heroku configurations. If you want to use some variable, remember **use the structure** following to the variable.

## üìù Final note
   This buildpack is unofficial that means i don't have any conection with Heroku or Google from Flutter developer team <!--Although I would like belonging to any of the two :D -->. This repository was made as a hobby, i'm always interested in learn new things, this is one demostration of that :)
   
Recently, [@ludwiktrammer](https://github.com/ludwiktrammer) developed a lighter version of this buildpack with some improvements, if you are having problems with size of project or you are using Heroku CI, i invite you to test it. [here's the repo](https://github.com/EE/heroku-buildpack-flutter-light)
